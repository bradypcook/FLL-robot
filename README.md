# FLL-robot
This was a robotics project I completed for one of my college classes. Although the code was originally written in block form using LEGO SPIKE, I have successfully converted it into Python.

However, I am not able to publish any of the original source code, NOR am I able to allow this code to be re-used by anyone else (without written permission from myself, as stated in the license), due to academic reasons. This is purely meant to demonstrate my python skills and showcase the work that I have achieved.
